# Super Platypus Drifter

## The game

Take control of the space ship of Billy Duck, a platypus who has to cross the infinity of space in a quest to help your kind.

By timing correctly your ship boosts, you must hop from planet to planet to advance in deep space while avoiding a variety of space hazards. Watch out for the fuel, you must collect fuel cans so you don't end *stuck in a loop* (:D), orbiting a planet endlessly.

### Two modes:
* Campaign, an epic platypus chronicle
* Endless: How far can you get with your ship in this procedurally generated map?

### Controls:
LEFT/RIGHT arrow or joystick: orient ship
Hold SPACEBAR o controller RT to charge booster
Release SPACEBAR o controller RT to impulse the ship (careful, you do not want to crash your ship)
